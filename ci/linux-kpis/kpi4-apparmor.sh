# KPI 4 — AppArmor conformance (critest, currently skipped).
#
# SOURCE OF TRUTH: lightr-cri handoff §4
#   crates/lightr-cri/docs/handoff/bench-cas-kpis-request.md
#
# CLAIM TO SIGN: critest AppArmor specs pass (profile actually applied to the
# container), removing them from crates/lightr-cri/ci/critest-skips.txt.
#
# PROBE: run critest's AppArmor specs against the real backend on a Linux box
# whose kernel has AppArmor (GitHub-style Linux runners do). The gap is the
# backend APPLYING the profile at container start — once it does, the specs that
# are currently listed in crates/lightr-cri/ci/critest-skips.txt go GREEN.
#
# PASS BAR:
#   - critest AppArmor specs GREEN against the real backend
#   - the corresponding lines are removable from
#     crates/lightr-cri/ci/critest-skips.txt
#
# MEASURE WITH (real backend, on a Linux box):
#   aa-status                                  # confirm AppArmor is in-kernel
#   # run critest AppArmor specs against `lightr cri serve` (real backend):
#   critest -focus="AppArmor" -runtime-endpoint unix:///run/lightr-cri.sock
#
# DORMANT GUARD: FAILS CLOSED until a Linux runner with AppArmor is attached and
# the real backend applies the LSM profile at container start.
