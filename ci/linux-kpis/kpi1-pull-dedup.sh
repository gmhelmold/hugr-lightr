# KPI 1 — Pull dedup (0-byte re-pull).
#
# SOURCE OF TRUTH: lightr-cri handoff §1
#   crates/lightr-cri/docs/handoff/bench-cas-kpis-request.md
#
# CLAIM TO SIGN: content already in the CAS is NOT re-stored on a second pull;
# the first pull writes only the novel blobs.
#
# WHAT IS MEASURED (honest): there is NO network bytes-in counter in lightr, so
# the signed metric is **new bytes written to the CAS object plane** —
#   du -sb "$LIGHTR_HOME/store/objects"
# measured as a delta around each pull/import. We measure the `objects/` plane
# (the content-addressed blob plane) and NOT the whole `store/`, because a second
# pull under a *different ref name* writes a tiny per-ref bookkeeping sidecar
# (imgmanifest/, imgmeta/, refs/) that is a POINTER, not content — including it
# would muddy a pure content-dedup signal. Every content-heavy byte (snapshot
# files, retained compressed layer blobs, config) is content-addressed via
# put_bytes and lands in objects/, so objects/ is the faithful "bytes written to
# the CAS" measure. We DO NOT claim "0 bytes over the network".
#
# PROBE:
#   1. cold CAS                          → baseline objects/ size (= 0)
#   2. pull image A into the COLD CAS    → record bytes written (B_A1)
#   3. pull image A again (diff ref)     → bytes written (B_A2): re-pull dedups
#   4. import image B (FROM A + 1 layer) → bytes written (B_B): only the novel
#                                          layer is stored; the shared A base is
#                                          deduped (per-file CAS objects)
#
# PASS BAR:
#   - B_A1 >  0           (cold pull writes novel blobs)
#   - B_A2 == 0           (re-pull writes ZERO new bytes to the CAS)
#   - 0 < B_B < B_A1      (only B's novel layer is stored; A's base is deduped)
#
# DORMANT GUARD: this script FAILS CLOSED until a Linux runner is attached
# (KPI_BACKEND_READY=1). It must NEVER emit a measured number it did not actually
# measure (tense discipline / Lightr law: no benchmark claimed as measured until
# a real run signs it).
