//! Daemonless, network-scoped userspace L2 switch (ADR-0018, F-304 Phase-2).
//!
//! Owns one `AF_UNIX`/`SOCK_DGRAM` socket per member (the host end of each
//! guest's `VZFileHandleNetworkDeviceAttachment` — de-risk spike S5-FHNET
//! proved one datagram == one Ethernet frame). A poll/forward thread runs the
//! [`switch`] (MAC learning + flood), and intercepts DHCP/DNS frames destined
//! for the gateway, answering via [`dhcp`] / [`dns`]. The switch is born by the
//! first member's supervisor and stops when the last member leaves (the
//! registry refcount arbitrates) — nothing of ours is resident between runs.
//!
//! ## Threading model
//!
//! Thread-per-member, matching the codebase's thread-per-conn std-net style
//! (see [`crate::portforward`]); no async runtime. Each member owns a receive
//! thread that blocks on `recv` with a 200 ms read timeout so it can observe
//! the shared stop flag. On each datagram (== exactly one Ethernet frame) the
//! thread calls the pure [`route`] helper, which decides — under per-frame
//! locks — DHCP/DNS interception then L2 forward, and returns the list of
//! `(PortId, frame)` sends. The thread performs the actual socket I/O (sending
//! to peer ports) *outside* every lock. Factoring routing into [`route`] keeps
//! the forwarding logic deterministically unit-testable (no threads/VM); the
//! socket path gets a focused smoke test.
//!
//! ## Buffer sizing (spike S5-FHNET finding)
//!
//! Reads use a [`RECV_BUF_LEN`]-byte (64 KiB) buffer because VZ can hand
//! `>1514 B` GSO aggregates as a single datagram; a 1514-byte buffer would
//! truncate them. We also best-effort bump `SO_RCVBUF` on each member socket
//! (skip silently if the `setsockopt` fails).
