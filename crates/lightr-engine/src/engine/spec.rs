// post-resolution mount type that `ExecSpec` carries MUST live in this lower
// crate to stay acyclic. `lightr-run::run::mount` (R-MOUNT's named file)
// re-exports `MountKind` + `ResolvedMount` and owns the pre-resolution
// `MountSpec` + the parser surface. AMBIGUITY RESOLVED MINIMALLY: the contract
// names mount.rs as the type home, but the engine→run cycle forbids ExecSpec
// from referencing a lightr-run type — so the carried types are defined here and
// re-exported there; the freeze-gate still lands ONE canonical surface.
