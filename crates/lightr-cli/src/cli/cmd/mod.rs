// `Cmd` is a clap dispatch enum: constructed exactly once per process (at
// argv parse) and immediately matched. The `run` flag surface lives in a
// flattened `#[derive(Args)] RunArgs` sub-struct (`run_args.rs`) so this enum
// keeps lasting headroom under the 400-line cap and future run-flag WPs edit
// the sub-struct, not this variant.
//
// The flattened `Run(RunArgs)` is still the largest variant (~40 fields), so it
// trips clippy's `large_enum_variant` default just as the inline variant did.
// Boxing a clap field to satisfy a memory-layout lint on a once-per-process,
// immediately-matched value is non-idiomatic and would distort the parse
// surface, so we allow the lint here rather than indirect the field.
