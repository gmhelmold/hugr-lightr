# Integration findings (WP-#97) — the seam COMPOSES; 2 cross-repo items to land it

- **From:** hugr-lightr TL · **To:** lightr-cri TL
- **Date:** 2026-06-26 · **Re:** composing `LightrBackend` into `lightr-cri-server` after your PR #1
- **Status:** historical report. Requests below are superseded by vendoring the
  lightr-cri workspace under `crates/lightr-cri` and wiring local path deps.

## What landed (proven)
I composed the real backend end-to-end: a new opt-in crate `crates/lightr-cri-serve`
(excluded from the hugr-lightr default workspace, so normal builds stay decoupled
from your repo) with an `Adapter(LightrBackend)` that impls your canonical
`cri_canon::CriBackend` (the one `run_blocking<B: CriBackend>` binds) by converting
the parallel-transcribed vocab types and delegating to `LightrBackend`. **It builds
green** → `Adapter(LightrBackend)` satisfies `lightr_cri_server::run_blocking` → the
swap composes with the REAL backend. All **23 trait methods are method-identical**;
conversions were mechanical 1:1 (both vocab crates are faithful transcriptions). Kept
on branch `worktree-agent-ac70bb39fd9480b0a` (commit `288458f`), NOT merged — it
can't build standalone until the two items below are resolved.

## 2 cross-repo items needed to LAND it (yours)

### 1. Resolve the `lightr-cri-backend` name+version collision
Both repos ship a crate literally named **`lightr-cri-backend v0.1.0`** (yours = the
canonical trait+vocab; mine = `LightrBackend` + its transcription). Cargo refuses two
identically-named+versioned packages in one dependency graph (`package collision in
the lockfile`). I validated locally against a throwaway version-bumped copy of your
crate. To land for real (and identically in CI git-deps), one side must disambiguate.
**Cleanest from your side:** rename the canonical trait+vocab crate (e.g.
`lightr-cri-seam` or `lightr-cri-contract`) OR bump its version distinctly — your call,
it's your crate. Tell me the final name/version and I'll point `cri-canon` at it.
(If you'd rather I rename MY impl crate instead, say so — but yours is the one many
consumers will import as "the seam", so renaming it to a seam-y name reads better.)

### 2. Transcribe the v1.2 security-context onto the canonical seam (blocks KPI 4)
The canonical `ContainerConfig` is still **v1.1** — no security field. My local
`ContainerConfig` carries the owner-approved **v1.2 `security: Option<SecurityContext>`**
(apparmor/seccomp/capabilities; see `shell-swap-followup-2026-06-25.md §1` for the exact
shape). The adapter therefore **drops `security`** (canon↔local), so **KPI 4 (AppArmor)
is UNREACHABLE through the composed path until the canonical seam is bumped to v1.2.**
Please transcribe the v1.2 shape (from the followup doc) into your `ContainerConfig` +
contract + the proto→field mapping in `create_container`, and add a shared vector
exercising `security.apparmor`. KPI 3 (cold-start) does NOT need this; KPI 4 does.

## Owner-gated (not yours, noted for completeness)
CI for KPI 3/4 needs the linux-validation job to fetch your PRIVATE repo (git-dep /
cross-repo checkout) → a fine-grained read-only PAT secret on hugr-lightr
(`LIGHTR_CRI_CI_TOKEN`). Owner is setting that up.

## On delivery
Give me (1) the disambiguated crate name/version and (2) the v1.2 transcription +
vector. I rebase the `lightr-cri-serve` scaffold onto them, switch path-deps → git-deps
(pinned), wire the CI job with the PAT, run critest-real against the composed backend,
and sign KPI 3 (+ KPI 4 once v1.2 lands). I won't touch lightr-cri — reply via your
channel.

## Current status

The two requested items are landed in this repository: the canonical package is
renamed to avoid the lockfile collision, and the seam carries v1.2 security
context. `lightr-cri-serve` now composes the vendored shell with the real
backend without git dependencies or CI-time sibling auth. A local privileged
Linux Docker probe with CNI passed critest with the declared skip ledger. This
is local probe evidence, not a signed benchmark or CI result. CI-signed Linux
KPI proof remains pending.

## HISTORICAL UPDATE (2026-06-26) — superseded by vendoring
The original integration used pinned git dependencies and CI sibling auth. That
arrangement was replaced by the vendored workspace and local path dependencies
described in the current status above.
