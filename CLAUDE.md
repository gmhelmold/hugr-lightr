## What HuGR Lightr is

**A daemonless, imageless runtime: workspaces materialize from CoreLink's CAS
in seconds, run under the lightest isolation the context permits, and never
re-run what the Action Cache already knows.** The local-first front door of
the CoreLink fabric:

```
HuGR (the company / brand)
 └─ CoreLink (the platform)
     ├─ Cache       — content-addressed CAS + Action Cache     (live)
     ├─ Runners     — ephemeral compute on the cache           (campaign #1)
     ├─ Workspaces  — workspace-as-object (clw client shipped) (campaign #2)
     └─ Lightr        — runtime front door, local-first          (THIS REPO)
   hugit (the forge for agent fleets)                          (campaign #3)
```

**Status (2026-06-25): R0–R4 LOCAL PRODUCT DELIVERED** — whitepaper v2 is canon;
feature tree F-001…F-605 built; ADRs 0009–0018 Accepted (docs/decisions-log.md).
Validated: the daemonless local core (store, memoized run/build, OCI import,
time-axis, lazy compose, docker compat, agent/MCP), the **`vz` engine end-to-end
on Intel x86_64** (F-205/F-206), and the **`ns` engine on public GitHub-hosted
Linux CI** (cold-start benchmark + net-namespace isolation — `docs/benchmarks/
RESULTS.md`). Honest-gated (not claimed validated): arm64 vz, Windows `wsl`,
Linux aarch64 `ns`; publish owner-gated (`G-PUBLISH`). In flight: CRI integration
front (`lightr-cri` sibling + this repo's `lightr-cri-backend`). Truth ledger:
`docs/spec/parity-audit.md`. TechLead installed (`.techlead/`, map at
`.techlead/memory/MAP.md`).

Read first: `docs/whitepaper/hugr-lightr-v2.md` (**canonical vision** — source
of truth) · `docs/adr/` (decision records — code is written only against
Accepted ADRs) · `docs/spec/build-spec-v2.md` (FROZEN R0 surfaces + acceptance + wave) · `docs/product/product.md` (ICPs,
pricing posture, open decisions) · `docs/VISION.md` (the funnel) ·
`docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` (engines, seams) · `docs/MVP-v0.1.md` (scope + DoD).

## Principles (decided — don't relitigate without the owner)

1. **No daemon, ever** — nothing runs when nothing runs; `ps` proves it.
2. **No images** — CAS manifests + chunks, lazy by default; OCI is an import
   format, not the model.
3. **Free local, forever, no account** — Stage 1 touches no servers; the
   funnel dies the day the first `lightr run` needs a login.
4. **Isolation à la carte** — `native` = reproducibility, NOT a sandbox
   (stated loudly); hostile tenancy gets `fc` hardware boundaries.
5. **Memoize-first** — the AC check precedes any provisioning.
6. **Pure client of CoreLink** — zero server changes; tenancy/auth/dedup
   semantics are CoreLink's law.
7. **Fail closed** — pinned inputs verified before spawn; no partial
   results; explicit errors over silent cold runs (runners discipline).
8. **Ship the public free tier after Runners M1** — demand must have
   somewhere to convert.
9. **Never charge for the customer's own compute twice** (platform-wide).

## Tense discipline (inherited law — never violate)

- CoreLink dedup is **intra-tenant at GA**; cross-tenant is **staged**
  (`CAP-DEDUP-CROSS-TENANT`). Never claim cross-tenant dedup as live; the
  network-effect moat *depends on it landing* and is stated as such.
- **Measured numbers are allowed ONLY when actually measured on named,
  reproducible hardware and cited as such** (updated 2026-06-25, owner-approved —
  Lightr is past design-phase). A benchmark/perf/footprint number may be claimed
  only with its run context (the box or the public CI runner) and a reproduce
  path; the measured ledgers are `docs/benchmarks/RESULTS.md` (Linux runtime, CI)
  and `docs/spec/benchmark-results.md` (macOS app-level, Intel box). Anything not
  yet measured stays an explicit **target** from cited precedents (Firecracker,
  Lambda, OrbStack), never stated as measured. Install counts: none claimed until
  real. The `performance-bar.md` targets remain DRAFT until a harness measures
  them on stated hardware.

## Relationship to the rest of HuGR

- **Consumes CoreLink Cache** (CAS/AC, tenancy, PAT auth) — pure client,
  like clw; does not fork or modify it.
- **clw (`corelink-workspaces`) is the distribution layer** — snapshot/
  hydrate/memoize pipeline + local L1 cache. Seam `C-SELF-01` frozen
  (`ARCH-02` approved, direct dependency): `clw` crates (`clw-types`,
  `clw-cache`, `clw-snapshot`, `clw-hydrate`, `clw-run`, `clw-manifest`)
  are direct path-deps of `lightr-index` / `lightr-run`; `WP-SELF-10` prepares
  `clw` absorption into `lightr-views` (`F-103` `CoW` `hydrate` → `O(1)` view,
  `ADR-0013` spike, not wired to run path). Interface: `Store` (`put_bytes`,
  `get_bytes`, `materialize_file`, `ref_put`/`ref_get`), `Manifest` (binary
  `LMF1` codec, `Digest` `BLAKE3`), `RefRecord` (`name` → `root` + `parent`).
  `contrato` → `seam` `interface` `lightr_index`; `direct dep` supersedes wire
  contract for `v0.1` (`build-spec-v2.md` §2: zero `clw` in `R0` core).
- **`Engine` lineage from `corelink-runners`** (`corelink-runner/src/
  isolation.rs`): same spawn/probe/exec/teardown contract, same fail-closed
  lifecycle. In the cloud, Lightr is what a runner lease executes; Runners is
  the fabric, Lightr is the runtime.
- The hugit↔runners integration contract is frozen from hugit's side —
  nothing in this repo may pressure that seam.

⚠️ Sibling repos under `~/Documents/HuGR/` (`corelink-server`,
`corelink-runners`, `corelink-workspaces`, `hugit`, …) frequently have
**other live sessions**. Read-only inspection is fine; **mutation across
repos is not.** Only work on hugr-lightr here.

## §9  Stage-2 Sync (`F-405`) — Wire Bridge Opt-In

`C-SELF-05` frozen (`opt-in`): `Stage-2` (`F-405`) = `wire bridge` (`net_fd`: `socketpair(AF_UNIX, SOCK_DGRAM)`; `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` §5 `net_fd` lines 126/149). Default `none` = `local` (`selfhosted` `base`; `free`; `local`). `Future` `cloud` `tier` (`fc` `F-209`) = `spike` (`defere`; `plan.md` line 13) — `honest Unsupported`; `selfhosted` `base` `funciona` `fc: None` (`zero regression`).

`net_fd` (`ExecSpec.net_fd`) `validado` `independente` `mesh` (`C-SELF-07`): `mesh` (`F-404`) = `LAN` `cache`; `design` `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`; `defere` (`plan.md` line 13). `wire bridge` (`F-405`) `nao` `exige` `mesh`. `net_fd` `independente` — `selfhosted` `base` (`store`/`run`/`cli`/`engine`) `funciona` `net_fd: None` (single-NAT-NIC path, `zero regression`).

`pure client` (`§6`): `selfhosted` `base` = `local`; `free`; `auth` `None` default (`C-SELF-02`). `Stage-2` sync `CoreLink` = `future` (`lightr-wire` `planned` `async` `clw` path-dep; `ADR-0011`; `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` §9 `revisado`). `Wave` (`WP-16` `Compose`) `local` (`supervisor` `F-308`) — `nao` `precisa` `Stage-2`.

`C-SELF-07` (`mesh` `defere`) `revisado` `independente`: `mesh` `design` `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` (`net_fd` `socketpair`) `revisado` (`independente` `C-SELF-05` `Stage-2`). `mesh` `futuro` (`F-404`) — `nenhum` `WP` `tenta` (`honest-gated`).

## Conventions

- English for repo documents; lean, evidence-cited (house style).
- Commits: `Co-Authored-By` trailers; canonical author `gustavomalleths@gmail.com`.
- **Once code exists:** branch → PR → merge, gates green before merge
  (inherit CoreLink/hugit discipline). Rust, exact-pinned deps where the
  house pins (see runners' Cargo conventions).
- Build/refactor waves go through TechLead (`Skill(techlead)`): decompose →
  contract → pack → dispatch → verify. The lead writes doctrine/contracts;
  the fleet implements WPs.
- Crate name `hugr-lightr`, binary `lightr` (verify `lightr` availability on crates.io + brew before any publication — ADR-0008 gate).

## Don't touch

- Other HuGR projects share the parent dir — never mutate siblings.
- `docs/whitepaper/hugr-lightr-v2.md` §13 principles and the tense-discipline
  rules change only with explicit owner approval.
- `.techlead/` is gitignored session state — never commit its contents.
